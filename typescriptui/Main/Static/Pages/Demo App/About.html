<p style="text-align:justify">
    <a href="https://typescriptui.codeplex.com/">TypeScript UI</a> is a user-interface library written in TypeScript language. 
    It is in Windows 8 Style and provides a powerful structure for creating HTML5/CSS3 web-based apps with an app/window-based 
    design structure. It works in any HTML5 capable browser (subject to limitations of host PC) but also includes fallbacks for 
    IE9 and Opera.

    However, TypeScript UI goes beyond just a normal user interface library. It also provides a structure for web-app focused 
    development. Built in are app classes and app starters along with support for splash screens, windows and touch support. It also
    provides an events structure which maintains context and allows events to be attached at any time (even when the DOM isn't 
    contructed). Finally, it keeps track of the underlying DOM objects for you and simply allows you to add/remove children with 
    ease and without worry of styles changing. All of this makes app development much faster and easier.

    The main aim behind TypeScript UI is to make app development in HTML5 faster and easier. With this in mind, it was developed to 
    offer similar structure and ease as Microsoft's Windows Forms applications do but while still taking advantage of the flexibility 
    of HTML/CSS. The library is strcutured into namespaces and CSS splits up layout/control required styling from the Skin styling 
    (i.e. colours, fonts, borders, etc.). Re-skinning an app is, therefore, very easy! All of this makes building a high-quality,
    unique app much easier! And it can be quickly be picked up by developers who are used to web or Microsoft language based 
    developement.
